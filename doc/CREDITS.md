## Credits

The BelugaProject uses parts and a lot of the concepts of the [tar1090](https://github.com/wiedehopf/tar1090) repository by [wiedehopf](https://github.com/wiedehopf) and of [dump1090](https://github.com/flightaware/dump1090) by [flightaware](https://github.com/flightaware). Maybe there are far more contributors. Please tell us if we have forgotten someone. 

The BelugaProject allows you to add live data from [Opensky network](https://opensky-network.org/) and/or [airplanes.live](https://globe.airplanes.live/).

By clicking on an airport icon you will see airport data from [OurAirports](https://ourairports.com/data/). Via hyperlink you can open the airport data website from [OurAirports](https://ourairports.com/data/) for the selected airport.

In our database we use data from
- [Opensky network](https://opensky-network.org/): aircraft data
- [Mictronics](https://www.mictronics.de/aircraft-database/) (used with [Open Data Commons Attribution License (ODC-By) v1.0](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/1.0/): aircraft data, operator data
- [OurAirports](https://ourairports.com/data/): airport data
